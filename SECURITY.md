## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the VecTrade Python SDK, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email **security@vectrade.io** with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Scope

This policy covers the `vectrade` Python package. For API-level security issues (authentication, authorization, data exposure), please also contact security@vectrade.io.

## Best Practices for SDK Users

- Never hardcode API keys in source code. Use environment variables (`VECTRADE_API_KEY`).
- Pin SDK versions in production (`vectrade==0.1.0`).
- Keep the SDK updated to receive security patches.
